<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [**USSLab**](https://usslab.org), Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuwenyuan/main) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuijh/home). I received my B.S. degree in Automation at College of EE, Zhejiang University in 2022.

My research interests include: (1) Speech security and privacy, particularly focusing on speech anonymization and voice deepfake detection;
(2) Sensor security and privacy, which focuses on physical signal attacks and defense against sensors in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and sensor-based privacy protecion.
