<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [**USSLab**](https://usslab.org), Zhejiang University, co-supervised by [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuwenyuan/main) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaoyuijh/home). I received my B.S. degree in Automation at College of EE, Zhejiang University in 2022.

My research interests include: (1) Speech security and privacy, particularly focusing on speech anonymization and voice deepfake detection;
(2) Sensor security and privacy, which focuses on physical signal attacks and defense against sensors in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and sensor-based privacy protecion.

[SoK: Understanding the Fundamentals and Implications of Sensor Out-of-band Vulnerabilities](https://dx.doi.org/10.14722/ndss.2026.230450)

**Shilin Xiao**, Wenjun Zhu, Yan Jiang, Kai Wang, Peiwang Wang, Chen Yan, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu.
To appear in **NDSS 2026 (CCF-A, Big4)**.

We provide a systematic analysis on sensor out-of-band vulnerabilities. We identify the physical principles and limitations that contribute to OOB vulnerabilities, categorize known attacks and evaluate their practicality, and analyze how CPS features such as sensor fusion, closed-loop control, and intelligent perception impact the exposure and mitigation of OOB threats. Our findings offer a foundational understanding of sensor hardware security and provide guidance and future directions for sensor designers, security researchers, and system developers aiming to build more secure sensors and CPS.

[MicPro: Microphone-based Voice Pirvacy Protecion](https://doi.org/10.1145/3576915.3616616) [[Paper](docs/pubs/MicPro.pdf)] [[Slide](docs/pubs/MicPro-v5-1124.pdf)] [[Code](https://github.com/USSLab/MicPro)] 

**Shilin Xiao**, Xiaoyu Ji, Chen Yan, Zhicong Zheng, Wenyuan Xu. **CCS 2023 (CCF-A, Big4)**

We propose the first privacy-enhanced microphone module (i.e., MicPro) that can produce anonymous audio recordings with biometric information suppressed while preserving speech quality for human perception or linguistic content for speech recognition. MicPro transforms formants, which are distinct for each person due to the unique physiological structure of the vocal organs, and formant transformations are done by modifying the linear spectrum frequencies (LSFs) provided by a popular codec (i.e., CELP) in low-latency communications.
